                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>
                    Here at El Sombrero we make some pretty yummy yummy tummy tummy mexican food yah. 
                    If you came down then that would be cool. 
                    We have mexican tacos, 
                    case of dillas, 
                    and wack a mole too. 
                <br>
                <br>
                    We custom designed the wack a mole by taking a cartoonishly large hammer, 
                    and f**king murdered a whole f**k-ton of rodents,
                    creating our beautiful wackamole blend.
                <br>
                <br> 
                    Our case of dillas, 
                    has been perfectly manufactured to hold the dillas, 
                    in a nice tight case, 
                    better than all the others, 
                    because we know whats best here at el sombrero, 
                    you dont, 
                    you f*ckin b*tch *ss p*ssy, 
                    you dont know sh*t, 
                    off yourself you cringe b*st*rd, 
                    happy birthday edison pong.
                <br> 
                <br> 
                    And last but not least, the mexican tacos. 
                    We used a home recipe from the internet, 
                    and made some really cool mecian tacos, 
                    and they taste like sh*t- 
                    just kidding they are 
                    really really really really really really really really really really really really average, 
                    not enough tomato sauce tho, 
                    so we added that, 
                    and removed most of the spices, 
                    but kept the salt, 
                    of course.
