            <!-- Introduction -->
            <p>
                Living just north of London was perfect, 
                as we were close enough to train into London for the day, 
                but also had easy access to the M1 and M25.
                We could easily drive anywhere, 
                and also had a train line passing directly through the town.    
            </p>

            <p>
                We tried to travel every weekend, 
                and some of our highlights are below:

                        This iconic old bridge is located right next to the Tower of London. 
                        We climbed across the top and were directly above the bridge 
                        when it opened up to allow boats through on the Queen's jubilee.

                        As a serious sports fan, 
                        visiting the home of cricket was truly memorable.

                        Bletchley Park is the home of computer science. 
                        It was site of the code breakers during World War Two, 
                        and renowned mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing worked there.

                        They were responsible for cracking the Nazis' Enigman code 
                        which was considered to be unbreakable. 
                        Many of the code breakers went on to make huge contributions 
                        in the field of computer science after the war finished.
